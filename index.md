# StatsApp
A modern stat-keeping application for high-school sports. 

#### Why StatsApp?
StatsApp has a quick input system that allows the stat-keeper to quickly input events that occured on the court. As of right now, these include 1, 2, and 3 point shots, fouls, technical fouls and "And-One's" for every player on the court. 
StatsApp also includes a player database that is updated based on when a lineup changes. These are pulled every year at the start of the basketball season. Incorrect lineups after the initial player roster is pulled.

#### Bug fix policy
StatsApp is developed and operated in the backend by one person, so it may take some time for issues to be fixed. Once issues appear [here](https://github.com/DiamondPG/StatsApp/issues), There is a long process of debugging and solving your issues and it can be a lot for one person to handle. We ask that you report bugs in the link above and they will be solved as soon as possible.
