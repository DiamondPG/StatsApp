# StatsApp

**Announcing StatsApp!** A new stat-keeping application for high school sports! StatsApp is designed for fast-paced sports including basketball. More sports coming soon. 

**What can StatsApp do?**

Using StatsApp, you can quickly and efficiently log statistics for players on the court. These statistics include Fouls, 3 - pointers, Points, and Total Points. These statistics will be updated with time, with more planned for the future. 

StatsApp includes an overlay which can be chroma-keyed into a live stream (Seen Below). This overlay is not yet customizable, though it is planned. The overlay details what just happened on the court, as well as the player's total points and fouls.

StatsApp gives a list of the players with the top points, fouls, and 3-pointers right on the dashboard menu. Customizability coming soon. 

StatsApp has a "Quick Entry" system. This system allows the operator to hit a keybind of their chosing, enter a team letter ("a" for Away, and "h" for Home), and a player number and StatsApp takes care of the rest. 

StatsApp handles all of the difficulties of Stat-keeping on paper, and simplifies it down to the very basics.
