# Error Codes

Here is a database of all error codes in StatsApp

## Format of Error Codes

Error codes are formatted in the following syntax:
Example Code: `L02CV-A`
> `L` indicates which section of the application the error occured in.
`L` - Launcher
`A` - Basketball
`B` - Baseball
> `02` is a designator for the error. Usually in order of error creation. This number isn't always in chronological order in the program.
> `CV` indicates the first letter of every word in the function title. Helpful for pinpointing exactly where the error occured.
> `-A` indicates the way the error occured. Helpful for pinpointing the section of a large function where the error occured.
