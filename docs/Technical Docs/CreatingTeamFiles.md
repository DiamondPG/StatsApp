# Creating Team Files

In order to create a new team file, create a new csv file in `{Documents Folder}\StatsApp`. Then, place the file in the folder that corresponds with the team your are creating.

For the contents of the file, use the following syntax for each player on the team.

> Player Number | Player Name

> NOTE: Don't use Excel to edit these .csv files. Excel adds extra columns to the file which mess with the ingest code.

These files will be recognized in two possible locations: The `Home Teams` folder and the `Away Teams` folder.
The `Home Teams` folder will show up in the launcher under the drop downbox. Any file in the `Away Teams` folder will have to be navigated to in the launcher using the "Away Team" button.
