# Creating Team Files

In order to create a new team file, create a new csv file in `{Documents Folder}\StatsApp`. Then, place the file in the folder that corresponds with the team your are creating.

For the contents of the file, use the following syntax for each player on the team.

#### Player Number | Player Name
> NOTE: Don't use Excel to edit these csv files. Excel adds extra columns to the file which mess with the ingest code.
