**NOTE: THIS VERSION IS AN LTS VERSION:** Long-term support (LTS) versions can only be downloaded with a setup file. This has to be done periodically to delete unnecessary files from the previous LTS. Patches can be downloaded from the GitHub repo as well as from the application. Patches will be compatible only with the most recent LTS. 

If you are downloading StatsApp for the first time, download the `StatsApp.zip` file. We recommend that you update using the launcher if you have StatsApp installed already.

# What's New in v0.8.4?

- Added ability to set a complex keybind. (ex. CTRL + F now works)
- Fixed a bug where Launcher would intermittently crash when launching Basketball.
- Version now shows at all times on the launcher window.

## Known Bugs

- The "Check for Updates" button is cut off in the settings menu.
