# Using the Dashboard

When you first look at the dashboard, it may look very confusing. Let's break it down.

## The Players

On the left and right side of the dashboard window are the lists of players. These contain all of the players from the teams selected in the launcher window. These players are displayed alongside their statistics. These statistics will be updated as you use the dashboard. 

## The Best Players

In the middle of the screen is a wall of text containing the best players in that respective stat. The top column being the highest scorers (People who score the most points). Each cell updates as you keep score and statistics. 

## The Score and Team Names

At the top of the middle section is the cumulative score of both teams. This score can be used to easily check if you have missed something on the court or just as a reference for how bad the other team is losing (knock on wood). The team names are associated with their half of the screen and can be edited in the `Edit` menu.

## Keeping Stats

It is now time to do what the application was designed for. Let's keep some stats! 

{: .warning }
There is currently a bug where an item has to be selected in one of the player lists in order to use a keybind. A patch is planned to be rolled out with the next update.
