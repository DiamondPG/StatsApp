# Getting Started

In order to get started you must have StatsApp installed to your computer. You can install the program using instructions from [here](https://diamondpg.github.io/StatsApp/docs/Installation.html).

## File Setup. 
When the program is installed it creates a folder named `StatsApp` in your documents folder. This folder contains all of the teams added to the Player Repo. For information on creating your own team files, please refer here.

In the `Sport` dropdown box, select basketball.
