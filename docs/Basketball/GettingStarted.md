# Getting Started

In order to get started you must have StatsApp installed to your computer. You can install the program using instructions from [here](https://diamondpg.github.io/StatsApp/docs/Installation.html).

## File Setup. 
When the program is installed it creates a folder named `StatsApp` in your documents folder. This folder contains all of the teams added to the Player Repo. For information on creating your own team files, please refer here.

> To add to the player repo, please open a ticket here. 

> For instructions on creating your own team files, reference here.

To get started, open the shortcut that was created on your desktop or open `Launcher.exe`.

Click on the first button, labeled "Away Team". This will prompt the user to select a file in the `Away Team` directory. Once selected, the file name will appear above the button. 

In the `Sport` dropdown box, select basketball.
